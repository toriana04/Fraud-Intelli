WASHINGTON—The FINRA Investor Education Foundation (FINRA Foundation) released today itssixth wave of the National Financial Capability Study, an expansive source of data and insights about the financial lives of U.S. adults that has been conducted every three years since 2009.
Following a 12-year period of sustained improvements in many of the key areas of financial capability included in the National Financial Capability Study—from the Great Recession of 2009 through the COVID-19 pandemic—the latest findings reveal an overall pattern of decline in U.S. adults’ ability to make ends meet and save for emergencies. While the comprehensive study shows no signs of overall declines in income, the findings show that increased costs have put more households under strain than in previous waves of the study.
The findings also indicate what can be described as a “struggle of the middle.” In many of the demographic breakdowns on measures of financial capability, the middle groups (those with annual household incomes between $25,000 and $75,000, those with some college education but no degree, and those between the ages of 35 and 54) appear to share many of the struggles of those in lower income households, without any college experience and younger cohorts. This is especially apparent in measures of difficulty making ends meet, the impact of higher food costs, setting aside emergency funds and engaging in expensive credit card practices.
“The 2024 National Financial Capability Study reveals a concerning shift in Americans' financial resilience. After more than a decade of improvements, we're seeing many households—particularly in middle-income brackets—struggling financially despite stable incomes. This 'struggle of the middle' signals that rising costs are creating financial strain across a broader segment of the population,” saidGerri Walsh, President of the FINRA Foundation.
“The FINRA Foundation’s National Financial Capability Study serves as an important barometer of Americans' financial health. By tracking trends over time and exploring the nuances of financial behaviors and attitudes, this study identifies areas where more support and education can create positive impact,” saidJonathan Sokobin, FINRA Foundation Board Chair and Chief Economist at FINRA. “This study is a vital resource that policymakers, researchers, educators, firms and financial professionals can use to better understand and address the financial capability needs of Americans.”
The National Financial Capability Study focuses on four components of financial capability:
Financial Knowledge.The percentage of respondents correctly answering at least four of five financial knowledge quiz questions has held steady since 2021. Men are more likely than women to answer the quiz questions correctly, though the gap appears to be closing with successive generations. The proportion of respondents who answer the inflation question correctly has increased by five percentage points relative to 2021, with the performance of those aged 18 to 34 improving by ten percentage points. The sub-topics covered include:
Related Information: In April, the FINRA Foundationpreviewed the state-by-state findings for financial knowledge and inflationfrom the National Financial Capability Study.
NOTE: The FINRA Foundation will hold a virtual press conference about the sixth wave of the National Financial Capability Study at 11 a.m. E.T. today. Unauthorized use of the press conference video or audio is not allowed.
Please reach out to[email protected]by 10:45 a.m. to register.
About the National Financial Capability Study
In 2009, the FINRA Investor Education Foundation launched the first national study of financial capability of adults in the United States. Since its start, the National Financial Capability Study has provided data on multiple indicators of capability—including financial behaviors, attitudes and knowledge.
National Financial Capability Study survey data is collected every three years. The 2024 survey, conducted from June through October, represents the sixth wave of data. Each wave of the study has data from more than 25,500 U.S. adults across all 50 states and Washington D.C. (500 per state/D.C.), and findings can be reported at both the state and national level. The sixth wave has been updated to include new questions on timely topics, including inflation, artificial intelligence and Buy Now, Pay Later, borrowing, among other topics. This extensive body of data is available for free to the public and researchers.
More information about the FINRA Foundation’s National Financial Capability Study, including reports and data from previous waves of the study and interactive data visualizations, can be foundhere.

Heather Walrath, an AFC and prior Fellowship recipient, offered her insights on what the opportunity has meant to her and her clients: “The AFC has been crucial in my ability to really empower military families. There are a lot of people operating in this space without the proper training. Having the AFC credential shows my clients that I am committed to continual learning to better support their unique needs. The designation is also very recognized within the DOD community. As an AFC, I've really valued the networking and being part of a community that wants to uplift - not only financial counseling professionals - but also the people we serve.”
By equipping military spouses with the expertise required for flexible, rewarding careers in financial counseling, the Fellowship strengthens financial security and enhances overall readiness across military communities.
""Our Military Spouse Fellows continue to demonstrate the profound impact that targeted financial education can have on military families,"" saidGerri Walsh, President of the FINRA Foundation. ""As this program enters its 20th year, we've seen how empowering military spouses with professional skills creates a multiplier effect—strengthening both their own career prospects and the financial resilience of the entire military community.""
“This year marks the 20th anniversary of the FINRA Foundation Military Spouse Fellowship,” said Rachael DeLeon, Executive Director of AFCPE. “Our latest class joins a passionate and supportive community that is dedicated to improving the financial well-being of military service members and their families. To date, FINRA Fellows have served more than 280,000 individuals, positively impacting military communities across the United States and around the world.”
The FINRA Foundation Military Spouse Fellowship is open to qualifying spouses of active-duty or retired Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, Coast Guard, and Army or Air National Guard or reserve component service members, as well as spouses of the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Professionals.

WASHINGTON—FINRA’s Board of Governors met September 17-18. The Board announced the approval of four rule proposals, approved proposed amendments to FINRA’s pattern day trading rules, and received updates on theFINRA Forwardinitiative, the Consolidated Audit Trail and FINRA’s cybersecurity program.
Rulemaking
The Board received a progress update on the FINRA Forward initiatives to improve FINRA’s effectiveness and efficiency in pursuing its mission. As part of the initiative to modernize FINRA’s rules, the Board’s Regulatory Policy Committee convened in July and approved four rule proposals in order to accelerate FINRA’s rule modernization efforts as part of FINRA Forward. The following approved proposals have been or will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):
Continuing its focus on FINRA Forward, at its meeting this week, the Board approved amendments that will replace the day trading and pattern day trading rules, including the minimum equity of $25,000 for pattern day traders, with an intraday margin rule that applies the existing maintenance margin rules to intraday exposure. The amendments are a result of FINRA initiating a retrospective review to assess whether the rules needed to be adapted for today’s technological and trading environment. The proposal incorporates feedback FINRA received from member firms, industry groups and investors from theRegulatory Noticelaunching the retrospective review. The amendments will be filed with the SEC for approval.
The Board also discussed a forthcoming Regulatory Notice that will reduce unnecessary burdens and consolidate prior guidance regarding the use of negative consent for the bulk transfer or assignment of customer accounts.
“The Board’s recent approval and discussion of various rule proposals are a key part of FINRA's ongoing efforts to enhance its regulatory effectiveness and efficiency through the FINRA Forward initiative,” saidFINRA Board Chair Scott Curtis. “The Board and FINRA’s leadership team will continue to prioritize helping enable member firms to better serve investors and facilitate strong and fair capital markets.”
Additional Updates
The Board received an update on FINRA’s cybersecurity program and recent developments regarding the Consolidated Audit Trail.
TheBoard alsoreaffirmed FINRA’sFinancial Guiding Principles, an integral part of FINRA’s commitment to financial transparency.

WASHINGTON— The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) and FINRA today announced thatregistration is now openfor the 2025 Joint Compliance Outreach Program, a two-day event to discuss compliance and regulatory matters directly with municipal market professionals. The program will be held virtually via Zoom on November 18 and 19.
The event gives market professionals the opportunity to share perspectives on how firms are evolving and responding to business, regulatory, and technology matters. This year’s program provides practical and tailored discussions addressing top concerns and interests among municipal securities dealers and municipal advisors, including conflicts of interest, broker-dealer primary offering and pricing practices, compliance concerns, and other key municipal market topics.
“The Compliance Outreach Program is dedicated to discussing regulatory challenges in the municipal securities market,” said Dave Sanchez, Director of the SEC’s Office of Municipal Securities. “Interacting with panelists and members of the public on compliance concerns and emerging issues helps regulators create a more efficient regulatory environment for the municipal securities industry.”
“We look forward to hearing from dealers and municipal advisors about opportunities and challenges in meeting their regulatory obligations in the evolving municipal securities market,” said MSRB Chief Regulatory and Policy Officer Ernesto Lanza. “Insights from this program will inform our retrospective rule review, which is an ongoing assessment of our rules to modernize requirements, reduce undue burdens and facilitate innovation.”
“The Compliance Outreach Program fosters essential dialogue between regulators and municipal securities firms,” saidMichael Solomon, Executive Vice President of Examinations and Membership Application Program at FINRA. “We are pleased to partner with the SEC and MSRB to offer meaningful conversations where municipal market professionals not only hear from their regulators but also work with them to advance this crucial market.”
Municipal market professionals can submit questions and topics of interest in advance of the event by emailing[email protected]. A recording of the event will be archived for later viewing on the SEC website.

WASHINGTON—In light of World Investor Week (Oct. 6-12), the FINRA Investor Education Foundation (FINRA Foundation) released today first-look findings from its forthcoming report, “Investors in the United States: A Report of the National Financial Capability Study,” which will be published in December. The report provides an in-depth exploration of the attitudes, behaviors, knowledge and experiences of retail investors in the United States.
As part of the study, researchers asked a sample of investors across the United States a question about investment fraud:
If you heard about an investment opportunity that promises a guaranteed, risk-free 25% annual return every year for the next 5 years, would you invest in it?1. Yes2. No3. Don’t know
Despite describing guaranteed and very high investment returns, two hallmarks of investment fraud, half of respondents (50%) indicated they would invest in the hypothetical offer, indicating a lack of recognition about the warning signs of fraud. Investors who are younger, less experienced and less knowledgeable about investing are even more likely to say they would invest in the “opportunity.” The data further reveals that investors who engage with investments that can carry greater risk, such as cryptocurrencies and meme stocks, as well as those who rely on social media for financial information, are particularly open to a hypothetical investment that promises much more than it can deliver.
Would invest in a “guaranteed high-return” opportunity

Notably, the differences by income in the proportion of investors willing to invest in the hypothetical offer were less pronounced, with only four percentage-points separating those earning under $50,000 and those earning $100,000 or more.
Would invest in a “guaranteed high-return” opportunity

“These findings reveal that a concerning number of investors might be vulnerable to investment fraud,” saidGerri Walsh, President of the FINRA Foundation. “All investments involve some level of risk, and investors must understand their own risk tolerance to make informed decisions. At the same time, investors must learn to spot the red flags of investment fraud—including the promise of little to no risk with unusually high returns,” she said.
The full report, part of the FINRA Foundation’s triennialNational Financial Capability Study, will provide comprehensive insights to help financial professionals, educators, regulators and others serve and protect investors of all backgrounds and experience levels.
Additional findings:
About the National Financial Capability Study
In 2009, the FINRA Investor Education Foundation launched the first national study of financial capability of adults in the United States. Since its start, the National Financial Capability Study has provided data on multiple indicators of capability—including financial behaviors, attitudes and knowledge.
National Financial Capability Study survey data is collected every three years. The Investor Survey is an online survey of 2,861 U.S. adults who have investments outside of retirement accounts. The data provides detailed information on a wide range of investing topics, such as attitudes towards risk and investing, investor knowledge, and reliance on so-called “finfluencers.”
More information about the National Financial Capability Study—including reports, data and interactive data visualizations—can be found atwww.finrafoundation.org/nfcs.

WASHINGTON—FINRA hasfined First Trust Portfolios L.P. $10 millionfor providing excessive non-cash compensation (e.g., gifts, meals, and entertainment) in connection with the distribution of First Trust investment company securities and related misconduct.
First Trust provided gifts, meals and entertainment to representatives of retail broker-dealers (client firms) that sold First Trust investment company securities, which significantly exceeded FINRA limits for non-cash compensation. In certain instances, First Trust preconditioned the non-cash compensation on client firm representatives achieving sales targets with respect to First Trust products (e.g., exchange-traded funds and unit investment trusts). In addition, First Trust wholesalers, who are generally responsible for marketing and selling financial products to client firms, falsified internal expense records, and First Trust sent client firms reports containing inaccurate information about the value, nature and frequency of non-cash compensation that First Trust provided to client firm representatives.
“FINRA’s non-cash compensation rule is designed to protect investors by preventing financial recommendations from being unduly influenced by excessive gifts, entertainment or other perks supplied to broker-dealers or their registered representatives,” saidBill St. Louis, Executive Vice President and Head of Enforcement at FINRA.
FINRARule 2341(Investment Company Securities) prohibits member firms from making payments or offers of payments of any non-cash compensation subject to specified exceptions. For example, the exceptions permit gifts that do not exceed $100 per person and an occasional meal, a ticket to a sporting event, or comparable entertainment so long as the gifts, meals or entertainment are not preconditioned on achievement of a sales target.
Between at least 2018 and February 2024, First Trust wholesalers regularly violated Rule 2341 by providing to client firm representatives gifts that significantly exceeded the annual limit and meals and entertainment that were so frequent and extensive as to raise questions of propriety. The gifts far exceeded even the higher limit recently proposed by FINRA. In May 2025, FINRAfiled a proposalwith the SEC to increase the gift limit to $250 annually, and in September, FINRA filed an amended proposal further increasing the limit to $300 annually.
For example, on more than 25 occasions during the relevant period, two First Trust wholesalers provided client firm representatives two courtside basketball tickets at a cost of approximately $3,200 per pair. In another example, over an 18-month period, various First Trust wholesalers provided one client firm representative entertainment, including tickets to more than 20 concerts and sporting events, with a total value exceeding $31,000. A First Trust wholesaler also preconditioned a gift of tickets to a professional hockey game on a client firm representative selling $1 million in First Trust products to his customers.
During the same period, First Trust wholesalers falsified internal expense records relating to more than $650,000 worth of non-cash compensation provided to client firm representatives. First Trust sent client firms false and misleading information about the non-cash compensation provided—omitting more than $500,000 worth of gifts, meals and entertainment.
First Trust also failed to establish, maintain and enforce a supervisory system reasonably designed to achieve compliance with non-cash compensation rules and expense-related recordkeeping requirements.
In settling these matters, First Trust consented to the entry of FINRA’s findings, without admitting or denying the charges. In addition, the firm agreed to provide annual compliance certifications to FINRA for three years regarding the issues identified in the settlement.
FINRA makes available disciplinary actions and other information on itsDisciplinary Actions Onlinedatabase. In addition, FINRA publishes on itsMonthly Disciplinary Actionspage a summary of disciplinary actions against firms and individuals for violations of FINRA rules; federal securities laws, rules and regulations; and the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. FINRA’s use of fine monies is limited to specific purposes set forth in its publicFinancial Guiding Principles, which are approved by its Board of Governors. FINRA publiclyitemizes and discloseshow it uses fine monies each year.
